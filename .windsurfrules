### 🔄 Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `blueprint.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `tasks.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn’t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `blueprint.md`.
- **Read `docs` folder** for additional documentation and examples.

### ✅ Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `tasks.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `tasks.md` under a “Discovered During Work” section.

### 📚 Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.
