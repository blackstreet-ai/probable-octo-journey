Below is an end‑to‑end multi‑agent workflow blueprint—expressed in the language of the OpenAI Agents SDK—for turning a single video idea into a finished, AI‑generated video ready for upload. It breaks the job into modular, traceable tasks, each owned by a purpose‑built agent (or small sub‑team of agents) and wired together in a mix of sequential and parallel patterns for speed and robustness.

1. Top‑Level View

Phase	 Goal	 Primary Agents	 Workflow Pattern
A. Ideation & Script	Turn a topic prompt into an approved shooting script	Orchestrator → Research → Scriptwriter → FactCheck → Script‑QA	Mostly sequential with feedback loops
B. Asset Creation	Generate visuals, voice, music, and metadata	Runs in parallel branches managed by Asset‑Coordinator	Parallel
C. Assembly & Edit	Build an FCPXML timeline, ready for rendering	Timeline‑Builder → Audio‑Mixer → Motion‑QC	Sequential
D. QA & Publish	Final compliance, thumbnail, upload, status report	QC‑Review → Publish‑Manager → Reporter	Sequential

The Orchestrator Agent (the “Executive”) oversees the entire DAG, spawning or messaging leaf agents, tracking statuses via the SDK’s built‑in tracing, and retrying failed nodes.

2. Agent Roster & Responsibilities

2.1 Orchestration Layer

Agent	Core Role	Key Inputs / Outputs	Notes
Executive Agent	Owns the job lifecycle, breaks user intent into sub‑tasks, assigns work, aggregates results	User prompt → Job spec object	Adds run‑level metadata, deadlines, budgets
Asset‑Coordinator	Supervises multiple asset branches (image, video, audio), resolves dependencies	Job spec → ready assets	Emits asset manifest for FCPXML

2.2 Content & Scripting Branch

Agent	Tooling / APIs	Deliverable
Topic‑Research Agent	web + LLM	Bullet‑point brief
Scriptwriter Agent	LLM (OpenAI)	Draft script in Markdown
FactCheck Agent	VectorDB + web + LLM	Redlined script + citations
Script‑QA Agent	LLM policy checks	Final “locked” script

2.3 Visual & Motion Branch

Agent	Tooling / APIs	Deliverable
Prompt‑Designer Agent	LLM	Optimized text prompts
Image‑Gen Agent	fal.ai image endpoint	Stills (PNG)
Video‑Gen Agent	fal.ai video endpoint	B‑roll clips (MP4)
Asset‑Librarian Agent	Cloud object store	Catalogued asset URIs

2.4 Audio Branch

Agent	Tooling / APIs	Deliverable
Voice‑Synthesis Agent	ElevenLabs TTS	Voiceover WAV
Music‑Selector Agent	Royalty‑free library API	Music bed WAV
Audio‑Mixer Agent	ffmpeg / DAW‑CLI	Final mixed WAV (loudness‑normalized, VO side‑chained)

2.5 Edit & Build Branch

Agent	Tooling / APIs	Deliverable
Timeline‑Builder Agent	Generates FCPXML	Full timeline XML
Motion‑QC Agent	Heuristics + LLM vision	QC report or approve
Thumbnail‑Creator Agent	Image Magick + LLM text overlay	Thumbnail PNG

2.6 QA & Publishing Branch

Agent	Tooling / APIs	Deliverable
Compliance‑QA Agent	Policy models	Pass/Fail
Publish‑Manager Agent	YouTube Data API	Video upload + metadata
Reporter Agent	Slack / email webhook	Final status & links

3. Data Contracts & Handoffs

Artifact	Producer → Consumer	Format
Job Spec	Executive → all branches	JSON (title, tone, runtime, target platform, deadlines)
Script v1 / v2 / Final	Scriptwriter / FactCheck / Script‑QA	Markdown + YAML front‑matter
Asset Manifest	Asset‑Coordinator → Timeline‑Builder	JSON list (URI, type, in/out points)
Mix Request	Timeline‑Builder → Audio‑Mixer	JSON (VO path, music path, gain/duck settings)
FCPXML	Timeline‑Builder → Motion‑QC	.fcpxml file
QC Report	Motion‑QC → Compliance‑QA	JSON (flags, warnings)



⸻

4. Control‑Flow Highlights
	•	Parallel fan‑out: Once the script is locked, the Asset‑Coordinator spawns Image‑Gen, Video‑Gen, Voice‑Synthesis, and Music‑Selector in parallel, shaving total latency.
	•	Event‑driven triggers: Agents communicate completion via the SDK’s AgentEvent; downstream tasks subscribe by dependency_id.
	•	Retry & Escalation: For fal.ai latency or TTS glitches, agent policies allow N retries, then escalate to Executive, who can fallback to a secondary provider.
	•	Versioning & Traceability: Every artifact is hashed; the Executive attaches run IDs to AgentEvents, enabling rollbacks.

5. Initial Project Scope & Milestones

Sprint	Focus	Done When
1. SDK Skeleton	Stand‑up Executive agent, simple DAG (Scriptwriter → Voice‑Synthesis → Timeline‑Builder stub)	“Hello Video” with black screen + generated voice
2. Visual Branch	Integrate fal.ai image/video agents, asset catalog, manifest generation	Timeline plays VO over placeholder stills/B‑roll
3. Audio Branch	Add Music‑Selector, Audio‑Mixer with side‑chain logic	Audio meets −14 LUFS; voice intelligibility ≥ 95%
4. FCPXML Output	Build robust Timeline‑Builder; validate in Final Cut Pro	Timeline opens and plays correctly in FCP
5. QA & Publish	Motion‑QC heuristics, Compliance‑QA ruleset, YouTube upload POC	Unlisted video uploaded with thumbnail & metadata
6. Hardening	Error handling, caching, observability, user‑facing dashboard	End‑to‑end run < 15 min, 90th‑percentile

6. Best‑Practice Notes
	1.	Small, Opinionated Agents: Keep each agent laser‑focused; easier to test, secure, and evolve independently.
	2.	Stateless by Default: Persist large artifacts in cloud storage, not agent memory; agents receive URIs + metadata only.
	3.	Observability First: Enable the SDK’s built‑in tracing; pipe logs and events to a central dashboard for replay/debugging.
	4.	Tool Isolation: Wrap external APIs (fal.ai, ElevenLabs, YouTube, cloud storage) in thin, typed tool wrappers so they can be mocked in unit tests.
	5.	Policy & Compliance Early: Bake policy checks (copyright, community‑guideline, voice‑clone consent) into the Compliance‑QA agent from day one.
