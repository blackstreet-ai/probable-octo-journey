  # Climate Policy Summit Yields New International Carbon Agreement

  - Reporter: Elena Rodriguez
  - Topic: International Climate Policy Summit Results
  - Target audience: General public, environmentally concerned citizens
  - Tone: Objective, informative with urgency

  ## OPENING (20 seconds)
  
  ### Anchor Introduction
  
  [ANCHOR]
  After five days of tense negotiations, world leaders at the Geneva Climate Summit have reached what's being called a landmark agreement on carbon emissions. Our senior environmental correspondent Elena Rodriguez has been covering the summit and joins us with the details.
  
  ### Reporter Lead-in
  
  [REPORTER]
  John, I'm standing outside the United Nations European headquarters in Geneva, where just two hours ago, representatives from 194 countries finalized a new international carbon pricing framework that could fundamentally reshape global climate policy.
  
  ## MAIN STORY (1:45 minutes)
  
  ### Key Development 1
  
  [REPORTER]
  The agreement, formally called the Global Carbon Accountability Accord, establishes for the first time a minimum price on carbon emissions that will apply to all signatory nations, regardless of their development status.

  That minimum price will start at $35 per ton of CO2 in 2026 and rise to $75 per ton by 2030—a level that climate economists have long argued is necessary to drive meaningful emissions reductions.
  
  ### Key Development 2
  
  [REPORTER]
  Unlike previous climate agreements, this accord includes enforcement mechanisms through trade policy. Countries that fail to implement the minimum carbon price could face carbon border adjustment taxes on their exports.

  The European Union, United States, and China—which together account for over 50% of global emissions—have all committed to implementing the framework, though with different timelines.
  
  ### Expert Quote 1
  
  [DR. AMARA OKAFOR, CLIMATE ECONOMICS INSTITUTE]
  This agreement represents a paradigm shift. By putting a predictable, rising price on carbon across major economies, we're finally creating the economic signals needed for businesses and investors to accelerate the clean energy transition.
  
  [REPORTER]
  But not everyone sees the agreement as sufficient.
  
  ### Key Development 3
  
  [REPORTER]
  A key component of the accord is the Climate Equity Fund, which will direct an estimated $100 billion annually from carbon pricing revenues toward climate adaptation in vulnerable nations and clean energy infrastructure in developing economies.
  
  [VISUAL: Map highlighting recipient countries with projected funding amounts]
  
  The fund addresses a major sticking point in previous climate negotiations: how to ensure that climate action doesn't impede economic development in poorer nations.
  
  ### Expert Quote 2
  
  [MARIA SANTOS, CLIMATE JUSTICE ALLIANCE]
  While this fund is a step forward, it falls short of what science tells us is needed. The $100 billion represents less than 10% of estimated climate damages already occurring annually in vulnerable regions. We're still placing the heaviest burden on those least responsible for the crisis.
  
  ## CONTEXT (30 seconds)
  
  ### Background
  
  [REPORTER]
  This agreement comes after the failure of three previous attempts to establish global carbon pricing, most recently at last year's summit in Bangkok.
  
  [VISUAL: Graph showing rising global emissions despite previous climate agreements]
  
  The breakthrough was largely driven by mounting economic evidence that climate impacts are already costing the global economy over $600 billion annually, coupled with recent advances that have made clean energy alternatives more cost-competitive.
  
  ### Broader Implications
  
  [REPORTER]
  For consumers and businesses, this agreement will gradually increase the cost of carbon-intensive goods and services while creating new incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy adoption.
  
  Industries like steel, cement, and aviation—which have been particularly difficult to decarbonize—will face the strongest pressure to innovate under the new pricing structure.
  
  ## CONCLUSION (15 seconds)
  
  ### Sign-off
  
  [REPORTER]
  The real test of this agreement will come in the implementation phase, as countries begin drafting domestic legislation to meet these new international obligations. The accord requires at least 65% of major emitters to ratify it before taking effect.
  
  From Geneva, I'm Elena Rodriguez. Back to you, John.
  
  ### Anchor Wrap
  
  [ANCHOR]
  Thanks, Elena. We'll continue to follow the market reaction to this agreement throughout the day.
